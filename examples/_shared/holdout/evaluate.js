// evaluate.js — the Dark Factory holdout gate (P2). Runs in a HUB-SIDE Argo step
// (NOT the untrusted Kata VM). Train/test separation for code:
//
//   * The hidden scenarios + executable tests (scenarios.json) are mounted here
//     from a hub ConfigMap. The coder never sees them — it has no k8s API access
//     and never clones this path.
//   * For each scenario we run BOTH signals against the coder's built code:
//       1. the executable test (hard signal — a stub can't pass a real test)
//       2. a DIFFERENT-FAMILY LLM judge (Nova vs the coder's Claude) reading the
//          plain-English scenario + the actual diff, run judgeRuns times; the
//          judge "passes" the scenario only with >= judgeQuorum yes votes.
//   * A scenario passes iff test-green AND judge-quorum. Gate = passRatio >= threshold.
//
// Env (from the workflow step):
//   REPO_DIR      checkout of the coder's df/issue-N branch (built + installed)
//   DIFF          unified diff of the branch vs base (for the judge)
//   SCENARIOS     path to scenarios.json
//   BIFROST_URL   LLM gateway base (ClusterIP)
//   JUDGE_MODEL   judge model id (different family than the coder)
//   JUDGE_RUNS    votes per scenario (default 3)
//   JUDGE_QUORUM  yes votes needed (default 2)
//   THRESHOLD     pass ratio to green the gate (default 0.90)
//   OUT           where to write the JSON result (default /tmp/holdout-result.json)
